# Quote Generator

Using external APIs and making HTTP requests are an essential part of any React application. To learn how to make HTTP requests in React, I have made a random quote generator.

What I learnt:
- useEffect (to perform side effects)
- HTTP requests with Fetch API
- Conditional chaining operator (?)
